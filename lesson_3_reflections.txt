When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When working on multiple devices, working with multiple people or when the project is really big

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because you might want to finish what you are currently working on before pulling new changes and because it could overwrite your own changes when you haven't pushed them yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	- fork: clone of an existing repository on the git servers (when you don't have access to the original)
	- clone: "copy" of a repository on server or local (when working with own repository or working with others)
	- branch: a row of commits, a clone can have multiple branches (when working on a new feature or bug fixing)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It's possible to work offline
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I've tried collaborating with Google Docs or Dropbox before and it was really not that good, sometimes changes went missing or new added files disappeared. At the beginning it is easier because you don't have to set up anything but in the end it's much more comfortable working with git

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?
